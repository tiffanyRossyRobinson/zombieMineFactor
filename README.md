# ZombieMine

This is a zombie version of MineSweeper. To begin, the player gets to decide which phase they want to begin their journey in the beginning(easy), middle(medium), or end(hard) of the zombie outbreak. Their mission is to navigate through the area without running into a zombie. 

Once the user selects their journey phase, the game will begin. If the user selects a zombie cell, the game is over, if they select an empty cell, the game will reveal how many zombies are near this location. If there are no zombies near this location, it will reveal the nearby cells and how many zombies are near those locations.
